# Simulation of a multi-agent robot system usage for building 
Robotic multi-agent systems are a rapidly growing field in today's world. There are a lot of research of how to use them, because such systems allow to combine simple to implement robots into more complex instances, that could perform more difficult tasks. 

In simulation we want to demonstrate how the concept of multi-agent robot systems can be used to replace builders on primitive construction.
